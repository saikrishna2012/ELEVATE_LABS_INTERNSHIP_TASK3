# Task 3: Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## Objective
This task focuses on implementing and understanding linear regression using a real-world dataset. The goal is to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Dataset
- Source: [House Price Prediction Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## What Was Done
- Loaded and cleaned the housing dataset
- Selected features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Built a Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression()`
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices
- Interpreted model coefficients and intercept

## Output
- `ELEVATE_LABS_INTERNSHIP_TASK3.ipynb` – complete code and visualizations
- Model ready for basic price prediction tasks
